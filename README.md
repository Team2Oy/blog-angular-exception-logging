# Simple testcases for angular error logging

This is an example/demonstration project for a blog post.

# To run node / express server that accepts and logs your UI errors

    cd error_logging_server
    npm install
    node index.js

# Run the UI

I for example just use netbeans and push the "run" button which starts internal server.

Or you can also just open index.html to browser.
